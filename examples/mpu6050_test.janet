# Reading a raw register pair:
#  Writing a single byte will tell the device to index at that register,
#  then the subsequent 2-byte read will return the register & register+1
#  In this example, the returned 16-bit value is big-endian, and must be
#  flipped; see (mpu/get-temp)

#
#  Since MPSSE is slow per-transfer due to the overhead, it is
#  more efficient to transfer as much data as you can in one shot.
#  For example, the Gyro registers are adjacent to the Accelerometer
#  registers, with the Temperature in-between; if you set a read point at
#  the GYRO_XOUT_H register, and read 14 bytes, that will get all 3 sets of data.
#  (6 bytes gyro, 2 bytes temp, 6 bytes accel = 14)
